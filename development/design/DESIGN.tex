\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose}
		In the RASD document we have presented the objectives and a general overview of PowerEnjoy system.
		The purpose of this document is to give more technical details about software and hardware choices that we have found for the system realization.
		However our main focus will be on software design, because this document will provide the fundamental specifications that will allow the developers to implement the application.
	\subsection{Scope}
		In order to best describe the architecture and the runtime view of the application, we are going to use different type of diagrams. Such diagrams should convey as much as possible the information on how the software is going to be structured.
		In particular we will present some UML diagrams:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{Component Diagram, to describe the high and the low level of the software's architectural structure}
				\item{Deployment Diagram, to describe the hardware's architectural structure and how the software is mapped on it}
				\item{Sequence Diagram, to describe the behavior at runtime of the software}
			\end{itemize}
		 We will specify which architectural pattern we have chosen and how they are used, we will give a description of the most crucial algorithms and a description of the user interface. Finally, for sake of completeness, we will show how every requirement defined in the RASD document is mapped in this document.
	\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations}
		\subsubsection{Rent}
			A \rent is the activity beginning with the pick up and ending with the release of a car. It can include some \stopover.

			\staff is the set of people that are \registereduser  but can perform special operations. They are divided in three different categories.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {Field \staff}
				\begin{itemize}
				\item They own a passepartout for cars reporting any issues \\ \par (e.g: cars with low battery).
				\end{itemize}

\section{Architectural Design}
	\subsection{Overview}%High level components and their interaction
				The system is split over a server and five client applications, for Cars,  PowerEnJoy users, Field Staff users, Emergency Staff users and Management Staff users respectively.\\
		The server  run business logic such as rent and reservation management, execute BPM and communicate with car's software to monitor eventual emergencies.
		The server relies on an external DBMS for data persistence, and multiple server instances are organized by a load balancer.\\
		The PowerEnJoy app interface the service's user with the back-end system in order  to register, to perform rents and reservations and to be updated of change in the terms of service. In addition it regularly update the user position's information in the back-end. \\
		Field Staff application is responsible of displaying incoming relocation and maintenance requests. It also contains information to quickly contact emergency support. \\
		Car's application is designed to handle the car-related steps of rent experience, providing remote data acquisition and actuators control capability to the back-end system.
		It regularly update the car position's information on the back-end, and enable the user to perform money saving option. Moreover it receives updates for the navigation system (such as new PowerPlug slots' or SafeArea's locations). \\
		Emergency Staff application provide an overview over all main service's informations to the corresponding staff and empower them with the tools to handle almost every possible emergency situation (cancel rents or reservations, assign relocation/maintenance requests, ...).  The app shows the information about the assigned emergency tasks for the app-user. \\
		Management Staff users can update and configure almost every service parameter by their application, from fares and discounts to term of services and SafeAreas' locations.

	\subsection{Component view}
		In this section the architectural overview is exploded into subcomponents, focusing on the server decomposition rather than the applications decomposition.\\
		A first global low-level component is presented to show the relations and the interfaces between all components, then the thematic areas of the diagram will be highlighted in separated sub diagrams, completed with textual comment of the individual components.

	\subsubsection*{Global considerations}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{ Orange components correspond to the applications }
		\item{ Yellowish components are the decomposition of server }
		\item{ Blueish components correspond external service's adapters }
		\item{ The server components are modelled to be compliant with Java EE technology. In particular each component will exploit Java EE persistence framework to synchronize data with the DBMS (that is the reason no component has explicit use of DBMS API).  }
		\item{ Each application connect to a single proxy component on the server, that is created every time an application log-in as that user type.\\ Those components will be Java EE servlet, which can connect with other business beans.\\
		E.g: PowerEnJoyUser log-in from mobile app (connecting to <Account manager>'s Login API), then a <PowerEnJoy User Manager> is created and associated to the connection with the app session.   }
		\item{ <Rent manager> and <Reservation manager> are stateful entity beans and are created every time a corresponding rent / reservation is issued for creation.  }
		\item{ <Account manager>, <Payment manager>, <external app manager> and <service configurator> are stateless beans in order to increase scalability and are pooled to avoid creation overhead, since are stateless. }
		\item{ <Account manager>, <Payment manager>, <external app manager> and <service configurator> are stateless beans in order to increase scalability and are pooled to avoid creation overhead, since are stateless. }
		\item{ <BPM> component is scheduled to execute its cycle every 15 minutes. }
		\item{ <Map manager> offer services to all other components, so it keeps cached versions of the computed data to speed up further requests of same API call. }
		\item{  <Emergency manager> contains several event observers. Every time an event is registered (e.g: car malfunctioning), generate a task and assign to other component's queue (<Emergency/Field staff manger>). In addition this component act as API aggregator for the <Emergency staff manager>. }

		\caption{Emergency staff app related components}
	\end{figure}
	
	
\subsubsection*{Management staff webapp}

	\subsubsection{Management staff webapp}
	Webapp (runs inside browser) used by management staff users to configure all service's parameter. After the initial login, enable the user to configure fares, discounts, fees, term of services and add/remove safe areas/power plug slots/cars.
	\subsubsection{Management staff manager}
	Dual component of the Management staff webapp on the server, it is created after the webapp logins, and it's associated to the webapp session. Redirects all users request for configuration operation to the Service Configurator.
	\subsubsection{Service Configurator}
	Component that provides an interface to modify every parameter of service. It is polled by PowerEnJoyUser manager to find out whether fares/fee/discounts/term of services have been updated. Moreover it is called by BPM/Rent manager/Reservation manager to compute prices and fees, since for flexibility reasons those informations are saved as DSL scripts (see Fare DSL, Discount DSL).
		\subsubsection{Fare DSL}
		Interpreter of a specific DSL (Domain Specific Language) to configure and compute fares. It stores each fare as a script,  dynamically interpreted when a price should be calculated. The DSL is specifically designed to mimic Microsoft EXCEL formulae syntax (extended with specific functions to access service parameters) in order to guarantee the faster learning curve to most part of the company's management personnel.\\
		E.g: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item { = Rent.MOVING\_TIME() * 0.50 + Rent.STOP\_TIME() * 0.15     \\time based fare, considering stopover (0.50\euro/minute for rent, 0.15\euro/minute for stopover)}
			\item { = IF( Rent.KM() > 10; (Rent.KM()-10) * 0.05; 0) 			      \\ km based fare, start after a minimum of 10 km 0.05\euro/km}
		\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Discount DSL}
		Interpreter of a specific DSL (Domain Specific Language) to configure and compute discounts. It stores each discount as a script,  dynamically interpreted when a price should be calculated. The DSL is specifically designed to mimic Microsoft EXCEL formulae syntax (extended with specific functions to access service parameters) in order to guarantee the faster learning curve to most part of the company's management personnel.
		E.g: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item { = IF( Rent.PASSENGERS()>2; -0.20 ; 0)     \\passenger discount of 20\%, if 2+ passengers (the returned value is multiplied by price and added to price as modifier, for an overcharge the returned value should be positive) }
		\end{itemize}

	\end{figure}
	
	
	\subsection{Deployment view}
	In the following figure we can see the deployment diagram. Here we show how the different components introduced in the Component View chapter are distributed into system's hardware components.
We have structured our diagram focusing on the workload of each component. We offer a real time service and we have to deal with these two principal data channels:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All cars are connected send continuously data in order to be monitored. 
		\item Every client connected to the service via Web App should receive responses in real time.
	\end {itemize}
In order to fulfill these two needs we have introduced load balancers that distribute the load among servers. 
We have both N Web Servers and Business servers. The first type of server guarantees the fair management of clients requests and responses. The second type guarantees the fair management of services running on the Business Server.
We store Data in a database which is separated from the server. The Database is duplicated in a backup database.\\\\
This architecture is compliant with the Java EE model, which usually consist in 4 tier: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{ client presentation tier (user app, staff apps and car system)}
			\item{ web tier (Account, Car, PowerEnJoyUser and  ``* staff'' managers servlets)}
			\item{ business tier (Rent,Reservation,Payment,Emergency and Map managers;BPM)}
			\item{ data tier (DBMS; Backupper) }
		\end{itemize}
		This four tier architecture also increase the security of business data, through a second firewall before Business server, and the secrecy/security of strategic component's code such as BPM.

	\subsection{Runtime view}%You can use sequence diagrams to describe the way components interact to accomplish specific tasks typically related to your use cases

				\centering
				\includegraphics[scale=0.22]{./SequenceDiagrams/Registration/Registration.pdf}% "%" necessario
				\caption{Registration}
		\end{figure}
	\end{landscape}
		\subsubsection{Registration}
		In this sequence diagram we can see how the components work together in order to sign up an user to the service.
		For all the next communications the messages are transfered by a web server from mobile app to server's modules and viceversa. This is done for security and optimization purposes.
		First of all, the registration form is requested to the web server and the user fills it, then the proper data are sent to the registration module.
		These data are used to check the existence of the same account in the database.
		If the existence is verified, the new registration is denied and an error page is shown to the user. Otherwise the documents information to be checked are sent to the proper authority and it is shown to the user a page that tells him that the documents are being verified. At this point the flow is interrupted and every time the user tries to access the account, it will be shown the previous message.
		Once the authority reply reach the system, an action can be performed. If the documents are not verified, an error notification is sent to the user, otherwise a new account is added to the database and a positive notification is sent to the user.
		\subsubsection{Reservation}
		The following sequence diagram shows us how the components interact among them when a reservation request is caught by the user's interface.
		In accordance with the specifications designed in the RASD document, we can see that the user can not only see the cars close to its location, but also cars next to a specific address. To do this is requested a conversion from textual address to geolocation coordinates to the web server of Google. Obviously the user position is taken from geolocation sensor embedded in the mobile.
		For all the next communications the messages are transfered by a web server from mobile app to server's modules and viceversa. This is done for security and optimization purposes.
		Once the position is determined, it is sent to the map manager. It computes the area close to the position and requires to the database the informations of the free cars in that place.
		The informations are sent to the user's app and now he can read the cars features and choose one.
		This choice is sent to the reservation manager that creates a new reservation in the database and begins the timer.
		After that the confirmation is sent to the mobile app and the local timer begins.
		Leaning to Google servers, is calculated the route from user location to the chosen position, to allow him to get the car without difficulty.

		\end{figure}
	\end{landscape}
		\subsubsection{Immediate Rent Request}
		In this other sequence diagram we can see more in detail the particular situation in which a user wants immediately rent a car when he is near it.
		For all the next communications the messages are transfered by a web server from mobile app to server's modules and viceversa. This is done for security and optimization purposes.
		The immedate rent request is sent to the rent manager that, after creates a rent in the database, asks to the car manager to unlock it. This module communicates with the car app and finally the operation is carried out by the car controller embedded in it. At the end of the operation, the appropriate screen is enabled on the car.
		At this point the flow is interrupted until the user fills the car screen with his correct PIN. After the insertion it is verified by a database query carried out by the rent manager. If the PIN is uncorrect, an error page is shown on the car screen and a new PIN insertion is requested, otherwise the "Focus driving screen" is activated on the mobile screen, the driving commands are enabled and the "Driving screen" is shown on the car. 
		\subsubsection{Money Saving Option}
		In this following sequence diagram the money saving option is described.
		We place ourselves in the situation in which the user is on the car and the rent is already began.
		The user fills a form on the car screen with the destination address. This address is converted immediately by google servers in a geolocation position.
		The user can now select the money saving option from the car screen. The request is sent to the rent manager and then to the BPM. The BPM computes the appropriate safe area where park the car and sends this information to the rent manager that communicates it to the car app.
		At this point the car app calculate the route to the destination using the own navigation system.

	\subsection{Component interfaces}
	\subsubsection*{Google Map API}
		In order to offer the service, our system will be interfaced to external services. 
		Map services are offered by Google.
		Specifically our system will use the following Google services
	\paragraph {Maps JavaScript API}
		This component will provide maps functionalities. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item map graphical representation.
		\item show markers
		\item show data on the map
	\end{itemize}
	\paragraph {Google Maps Geocoding API}
		Geocoding is the process of converting addresses, like a street address, into geographic coordinates. It will be used to position the map around a certain marker, prepare the car research request around a certain address.
		\par It will be used from \powerenjoy user application when he search to a specific address in the map.
	\paragraph {Google Places API Web Service}
		It works as the Geocoding API,  but it transforms remarkable places into geographic coordinates.
	\paragraph {Google Maps Geolocation API}
		The Google Maps Geolocation API returns a location and accuracy radius based on information about cell towers and WiFi nodes that the mobile client can detect. \par It will be used in order to detect the user position(Both \powerenjoy user and \fieldstaff users)  if the GPS signal of their smart device is not available.

\subsection{Selected architectural styles and patterns} %Please explain which styles/patterns you used, why, and how
	\subsubsection{High Level Description}
	Our service will use a \textit{client/server} based architecture, 4-tier architecture. Client will be of three types, Smartphone clients, Web Browser clients, Car Clients.
	\paragraph{Smartphone Clients} these type of clients will run the application developed for \powerenjoy users and for \fieldstaff users. The smartphone clients will be thick clients because even  if the Business logic will be elaborated in the Private Servers, the native application will render all the data using JavaScript. 
		\par Specifically the applications will run on different platforms without rewriting code. It will be written using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. We release the native application using Phonegap Build. 
		\par The application will be able to access to the client positioning system.
		\par The client will send request and receive data both from the Google maps services and from the web server.
	\paragraph{Web Browser Clients} these type of clients will run the service for the office \staff, it will allow the interface to the services of these two kind of clients. It will work using JavaScript, CSS, HTML5. 
	\paragraph{Car App Client} 
	This is the application that runs into \powerenjoy cars. It interfaces to the directly to the Private server via remote communication protocol. This client allows to manage the car remotely, to handle the \moneysaving requests and to set recommended destinations.
	\paragraph{Web Server}
	It is the interface between the Clients and the Private server. It manages the requests that come from the web clients. 
	\paragraph{Private Server}
	The private server runs all the business logic. It is developed using a \fnurl{microsevice architectural pattern}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices}. This architecture guarantees that services are easy to be replaced and introduced. It also help the server maintainability, specifically if a component fails the error is only in its module
	\paragraph{DBMS}
	It supports the business logic processes providing data via SQL queries using ODBC protocol.
	\subsection{Other design decisions}
		\subsubsection{Programming Language}
			 For the implementation of PowerEnjoy system we choose Java as programming language. This choice is based on the following considerations:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{Java is a very wide spread programming language, so we are sure that there will be more availability of skilled programmers in this technology.}
				\item{The system shall be developed on the Java EE platform, that ensures us large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure properties.}
			\end{itemize}
\section{Algorithm Design} %Focus on the definition of the most relevant algorithmic part 
	We are now going to present the most relevant algorithms of our application using some pseudo-code. The algorithms on which we focused our attention are those which manage the car search and the BPM logic.\\
	The syntax used to describe the algorithm stick to Python language, for its readability, but makes wide use of comments to better explain some functionalities without focusing too much on actual code.
	\subsection{Car search}
		The algorithm describes the behavior of the car search function. This function performs a search of the cars belonging to the circle having "location" as center and "radius" as radius. This is done by executing a DBMS query. Finally the result is returned as an array of objects.\\
		In the code is present an SQL query to give an idea of how the DBMS capabilities are exploited in order to perform some parts of the algorithm.
		\clearpage
		\code{Car search:}{./Algorithm/CarSearch/car_search.py}
	\subsection{BPM}
		This algorithm cover the main functionalities of the BPM component:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item assigning relocations to field staff users
			\item recommending destination for money saving options
		\end{itemize}
		In order to accomplish so, a sequence of intermediate steps is repeated in a cycle every 25 minutes, since the field staff reaction time is supposed to be 15 minutes in the domain assumptions.
		These steps include the computation of a relocation priority for cars (to relocate away) and safe areas / power plug slots (to relocate in), which will be used to select the relocations by picking the car and the safe area with highest priority, and assigning that relocation to field staff user with lower amount of queued tasks.\\\\
		NOTE: the relocation priority for cars and safe areas is computed as a number, whose value decreases as the priority increases.
		Two special values are reserved for battery charge related relocations, which have maximum priority:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{ PRIORITY\_HIGH 	     (-1) 	for car with empty battery parked in a safe area }
			\item{ PRIORITY\_HIGHEST (-2) 	for car with empty full battery parked in a power plug slot }
		\end{itemize}
		For cars parked in safe area, the priority is computed looking at two different criteria,  weighted in different ways:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item{ Cars parked in over-parked city zones should be relocated with priority proportional to the car excess in the zone. \\
					Weighted by IMPORTANCE\_HIGH (1e10) to have maximum impact over the priority. }
			\item{ Among the safe areas in same city zone, cars parked in almost-full safe areas have precedence. This is represented by the safe area load factor (parked cars / safe area capacity). \\ 
			Weighted by IMPORTANCE\_LOW (1e5) to have impact over the priority only when safe areas are in the same city zone. }
		\end{enumerate}
		For example, consider 3 cars:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item{ parked in safe area with load factor 0.75, in city zone with +20 cars w.r.t. the optimal car number: \\
			Computed priority is:\\
			 $
			 priority = {1 \over \Delta cars} \times importance\_high + load\_factor \times importance\_low = 500075000
			 $}
			\item{ parked in safe area with load factor 0.1, in city zone with +100 cars w.r.t. the optimal car number.\\
			Computed priority is:\\
			 $
			 priority = {1 \over \Delta cars} \times importance\_high + load\_factor \times importance\_low = 100010000
			 $ }
			\item{ car with \textbf{empty battery} parked in safe area with load factor 0.05, in city zone with -20 cars w.r.t. the optimal car number.\\
			Computed priority is:\\
			 $
			 priority = -1,  \text{because is a special case}
			 $}
		\end{enumerate}
		The cars will be sorted by relocation\_priority in descendent order, thus relocated in order: [3], [2], [1].\\
