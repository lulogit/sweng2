	\subsection{Glossary}
		\subsubsection{Car Sharing}
			\carsharing is a model of car rental where people rent cars for short periods of time, often by the hour.
		\subsubsection{PowerEnJoy}
			\powerenjoy is the \carsharing brand object of this document. 
		\subsubsection{Registered User}
			A \registereduser is a person subscribed to \powerenjoy which can access to the \carsharing through his smart-phone.
		\subsubsection{Staff}
			\staff is the set of people that are \registereduser but can perform special operations. E.g. They own a passepartout for all cars that has all kind of issues, like Low battery.
		\subsubsection{Service}
			The \service is the group of actions that a \registereduser can fulfill trough the mobile.	
		\subsubsection {Safe Area}
			A \safearea is a  geographical place\footnote{defined by a set of GPS positions} on the map in which parking is allowed. \safearea are saved into the system. A \registereduser can end a \carsharing parking his car only in safe areas.
	\subsubsection{Power Grid}
		A \powergrid is the station that charge the battery of an electric car. All \powergrid are displayed in the map onboard \powerenjoy cars. Each \powergrid is in a \safearea. A \registereduser who plugs his car into a \powergrid receives the discount expected within \powerenjoy rules.
	\subsubsection{Reservation}
		A \resevation is the possibility that a \registereduser has to book a car at the latest for one hour.
	\subsubsection{Stand}
		A \stand is the possibility that a \registereduser has to pause his \carsharing. During a \stand the \registereduser can leave the car, than he can re-unlock it through his samrt-phone 

\subsection{Further Developments}
	We think that one of the most important things is to release a Service that can be extended and improved. It's trivial that a service like this must be able to be change and be updated.
	For this purpose we will develop a system open to new extensions. \\
	Here we provide a series of possible extensions that could be necessary in the future.
	E.g.:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item New kind of discount policies can be introduced to the system, for example discounts for new users. 
		\item New system policies may be necessary, for example new \carsharing conditions.
		\item New kind of vehicles can be introduced, for example electric scooter and electric bikes.
		\item Support to new payment methods, for example Paypal\textregistered, NFC\footnote{Near Field Communication; NFC devices are used in contactless payment systems, similar to those used in credit cards and electronic ticket smartcards and allow mobile payment to replace/supplement these systems. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication}{NFC on Wikipedia}}.
		\item Develop new services in order to increase the user experience, for example it may be useful to allow communication among users in order to share a car ride and save money.
