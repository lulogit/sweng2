\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose }
	\subsection{Scope and Problem Description}
	\subsection{Goals}
	We have selected a list of objectives that we think \powerenjoy  has to reach:
	\begin{description}
		
		\begin{comment} drivers for PowerEnjoy's success \end{comment}
		\item [G.1]{ To allow user to simply access to the \powerenjoy services. }
		\item [G.2]{ To guarantee an higher  probability of finding a car, compared to other car sharing services. }
		\item [G.3]{ To guarantee an efficient manutenution and recharge process of the cars, oriented to favorite their fairly distribution over the territory. }
		\begin{comment} user's goals \end{comment}
		\item [G.4]{ To allow users to make a reservation for a car in advance, and to cancel a reservation by its expiration time. }
		\item [G.5]{  To transparently charge the user for the service, minimizing its interaction with payment interfaces. }
		\item [G.6]{  To allow users to drive cars, minimizing their efforts for finding safe areas where to park.}
		\item [G.7]{ To encourage users' virtuous behaviour  in relation to service's fairness. }
		\begin{comment} service efficiency goals \end{comment}
		\item [G.8]{ To create a system that gives the possibility to be monitored and administrated by \powerenjoy's authorized personal. }
		\item [G.9]{  To empower the authorized personal in order to be able to quickly react to emergencies, potentially dangerous situations and users' requests for help.}
		\item [G.10]{ To create a system that provides a programmable interface, in order reduce the costs of further enanchements / manutenution to the system exploiting internal personal or third party developers.}
